            "I have lost more than Rs. 50000 because of the negligence and security issues of the bank. Unknown transactions have been done on my card, even though i haven\u2019t even use my debit card physically to take out money or even for payment. This is really sad and they are so insensitive that I have tried reaching them so many times, even went to the bank, they do not provide any update. They are completely passing on the responsibility to other teams in order to escape being responsible for the inconvenience that has occured to me. \nI need my money back asap. I have given all details. I need the inquiry to be taken on priority, it is a huge amount. And please tighten your security measures. How can someone make so many transactions without needing any otp or verification. This makes me feel that I have chosen the wrong bank. Please take action immediately. \nHoping for a reply here at least.",
